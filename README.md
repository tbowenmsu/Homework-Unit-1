# Homework-Unit-1


  ##This project goal was to take existing code that works properly and to:
    *Reorganize into semantic code.
    *clean up the code in the html so it reads easier.
    *Change the code so that it is more accesible on the web page for persons with disabilities. 
    *clean up a lot of the repeating code in the css sheet for styling.
  
  ##How I tackled this project:
    *I first went through and looked at all of the html code and slowly started thinking of ways to make it more organized by comparing it to codes we have already used in class.
    *I noticed that a lot of the "div" are useless and frowned upon for use of accesibility. I then went through and looked for all of the ways i could make it more accessible.
    *I then went through and spaced things correctly to give me space and organization to work with. 
    *then looking at the webpage itself i wrote down all of the elements that looked like they shared the same styling and bunched them into families and gave them new class      types. 
    
  ##Problems/difficulties
      *I had to goole a lot of accesibility items. i found a lot of great resources from ARIA forums and MDN such as this [article on ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA). This then led me down a rabbit hole of different elements and problems that could occur.
      *I had a large time consuming issue with the main background photo and trying to set an alt tag for ereaders. I ended up finding a forum that had the same problem and so i learned to use the Aria-label tag on a hero image within the span element so that it would take up the whole space of the page with global attributes in that span. 
      *I had an issue with my style sheet not talking to my html after i changed from div to more specific classes and was trying to reduce the clutter from my stylesheet. I finally figured out that i needed to remove the periods from the front of header since I changed that to header elements instead of div elements for the sake of semantics.
     
  ##CSS problems
      *my biggest issues here was staying organized since i worked too far ahead and changed too many things on my HTML sheet without making the corresponding changes in my CSS. 
      * I ended up bringin up the unsolved version and using that to remember the changes i made and then adding in notes to my homework page and then making the necessary changes in my CSS. 
      * I didnt need to do much adding any css elements because it was really a matter of changing names and consolidation into classes from the HTML.
      *again the hero image took a lot of my time and googling to figure out to add dsplay block to my hero background to make it take up the whole screen.
      *There was a small glitch i wasnt able to figure out witht the background color of the smaller box on the page so i manually went through and changed to the color to try and match the photo.
      
  ##Things i might do differently next time
      * In class we learned about the root at the top of the css so that you can essentially give nicknames to certain attributes. I would find that much more organizing and useful than retyping the specific color code each time. 
      I would work on bothe the html and css together because i moved to far in my html and didnt keep up with css and lost track of where i was.
